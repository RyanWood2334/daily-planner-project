# daily-planner-project

## Description

This application is a daily planner that tracks the hour of the day and takes user input and stores it in local storage for later. It also displays today's date in the header. This project was really fun, and it reall expanded my knowledge of local storage, which is definitely an area of needed improvement for me! Nevertheless, fun project.
